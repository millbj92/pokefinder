The location APIs available in Google Play services facilitate adding location awareness to your app with automated location tracking, geofencing, and activity recognition.\n\n\n\nRequired Android API Levels\n===========================\n\nWe recommend setting your app\u0027s *Target Framework* and *Target Android version* to **Android 5.0 (API Level 21)** or higher in your app project settings.\n\nThis Google Play Service SDK\u0027s requires a *Target Framework* of at least Android 4.1 (API Level 16) to compile.\n\nYou may still set a lower *Minimum Android version* (as low as Android 2.3 - API Level 9) so your app will run on older versions of Android, however you must ensure you do not use any API\u0027s at runtime that are not available on the version of Android your app is running on.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Manifest \n================\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require specific metadata, attributes, permissions or features to be declared in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file.\n\nThese can be added manually to the *AndroidManifest.xml* file, or merged in through the use of assembly level attributes.\n\n\nThe SDK requires the *CourseLocation* or *FineLocation* permission(s) to work correctly.  If you specify *CourseLocation* location accuracy will be lower than if you choose *FineLocation*.  Pick the appropriate one for your application.  You can have these automatically added to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file by including the following assembly level attributes:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.FineLocation)]\n// Or\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.CourseLocation)]\n```\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n==========\n\nYou can learn more about the various Google Play Services SDKs \u0026 APIs by visiting the official [Google APIs for Android][3] documentation\n\n\nYou can learn more about Google Play Services Location by visiting the official [Location](https://developer.android.com/training/location/index.html) documentation.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://console.developers.google.com/ \"Google Developers Console\"\n[2]: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/MD5_SHA1/ \"Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints\"\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/android/ \"Google APIs for Android\"\n\n","Hash":"b3076f9a00a7ed6f33401f9d0f95787a","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
